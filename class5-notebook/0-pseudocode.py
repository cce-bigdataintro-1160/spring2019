# Write pseudocode for a program that reads the titanic file and saves two other files
# one for the male passengers and
# another for the female passengers

# open the titanic file

# create a male and a female lists

# loop over every line

# if the line contains male
#   add it to the male list
# otherwise
#   add it to the female list

# if the male list isn't empty create a file for it's contents
# if the female list isn't empty create a file for it's contents


# what about check (file already exists, can't create file, etc)
